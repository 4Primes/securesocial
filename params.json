The 'master' branch is for the Play 2 version only.\r\n\r\n# SecureSocial Module for Play 2 \r\n\r\nSecureSocial allows you to add an authentication UI to your app that works with services based on OAuth1, OAuth2 and OpenID protocols.  SecureSocial provides Scala and Java APIs so you can integrate it using your preferred language.\r\n\r\nThe following services are supported in this release:\r\n\r\n* Twitter (OAuth1)\r\n* Facebook (OAuth2)\r\n* Google (OAuth2)\r\n* LinkedIn (OAuth1)\r\n* GitHub (OAuth2)\r\n\r\nThe following are going to be supported shortly:\r\n\r\n* Yahoo \r\n* Foursquare \r\n* MyOpenID \r\n* Wordpress \r\n* Username and Password (in progress)\r\n\r\nThe module does not depend on any external Java libray. It relies only on what the Play! Framework provides and uses the awesome <a href=\"http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/\">Bootstrap toolkit from Twitter</a> to style the UI.  \r\n\r\nSource code is available at <a href=\"https://github.com/jaliss/securesocial\">https://github.com/jaliss/securesocial</a>\r\nWritten by Jorge Aliss (<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/jaliss\">@jaliss</a>)\r\n\r\n## Licence\r\n\r\nSecureSocial is distributed under the \"Apache 2 licence\":http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html.\r\n","name":"SecureSocial","google":"UA-1441023-12"}
